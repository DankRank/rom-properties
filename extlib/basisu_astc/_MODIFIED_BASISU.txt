These files were originally sourced from Basis Universal v1.15.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Only the ASTC decoder is included. It has been modified to build without
  the rest of Basis Universal, e.g. using std::max<> instead of
  basisu::maximum<>.

- Large 32-bit arrays have been converted to 8-bit.

- Added fall-through comments.

- Swap the R and B channels to match the expected data formats.

- Converted some large ternary comparison trees to switch/case.

- Proper byteswapping for Big-Endian architectures.
