This copy of uniwidth is a modified subset of gnulib.

commit 044bf893acee0a55b22b4be0ede0e3ce010c480a
tempname: simplify by omitting _LIBC code

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Only the uniwidth subset is included.

- A CMake build system has been added.

- .in.h files have been changed to .h.

- CJK encoding checks have been removed, since we're only
  using UTF-8.
