Merge pull request #1138 from lz4/dev

stage v1.9.4

Tag: v1.9.4

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Disabled some options.

- Added TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES().

- Set LZ4_DLL_EXPORT=1 to ensure the import library is built,
  and LZ4_DLL_IMPORT to optimize DLL imports.

- Added the Win32 resource file to the DLL build.

- MSVC builds: Debug DLLs now have a 'd' postfix.

- Removed CI configuration files.

- Don't check for gcc warning flags on MSVC and vice-versa
  This merely wastes time.
